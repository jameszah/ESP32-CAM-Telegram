# ESP32-Cam-Telegram
Demo of sending a photo from a ESP32-CAM acting as a Telegram BOT

https://github.com/witnessmenow/Universal-Arduino-Telegram-Bot/issues/186#issue-654370487

Bugfix on line 239 of .cpp (line 240 is my version)
Also demo sending a big .jpg two ways - one of which fails

Some other changes - search for jz

Just add wifi name/pass and BOTtoken, then send /photo from your Telegram BOT and look at serial monitor for debug messages, and telegram for one picture
